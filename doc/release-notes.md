### 2.0.10 *Feb 19, 2015*


- [Todo MVC example](https://github.com/txchen/feplay/tree/gh-pages/riot_todo)
- Array items can be sorted and reordered and the view updates accordingly. Thanks to [@pakastin](https://github.com/pakastin)!
- Nested `style` tags are automatically inject into `<head>` to avoid duplicate definitions
- Ability to define tags on the same line: `<tag></tag>`
- Single line ES6 style methods: `foo() { this.bar = 'baz' }`
- No illegal server requests with images: `<img src={ src }>`
- Fix compiler to support custom brackets
- `this.update()` is no longer automatically generated by the compiler for ES6- type methods. This method is now called on the Riot library on client when event handlers are called
- [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/muut/riotjs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)


### 2.0.9 *Feb 13, 2015*

- LiveScript support
- Ability to set `if`, `show` and `hide` attributes for a custom tag
- Multiple class shortcut: `{ 'foo bar': baz }`
- Took away `children` property, which was designed for theoretical need mostly.
- A memory leak fix on `riot.observable`. Thanks to [@GianlucaGuarini](https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini) for the hard debug work and everyone else on this [pull request](https://github.com/muut/riotjs/issues/248)


### 2.0.8 *Feb 9, 2015*

- New `unmount()` method and `children[]` property for [tag instances](/riotjs/api/#tag-instance)
- One way data flow: updates and unmounts always propagate downwards from parent to children
- The `if` attribute now works as expected by adding or removing the root node from DOM
- [Compiler API](/riotjs/api/#compiler) exposed to the public
- Global variables are supported in expressions, e.g. `{ location }`
- Customizable `.tag` extension, e.g. `riot --ext html`
- [Customizable brackets](/riotjs/api/#brackets), e.g. `riot.settings.brackets = '${ }'`
- Ability to print the current version with: `riot --version`
- The semi-hidden `riot._tmpl()` is now completely hidden and not part of the global `riot` object
- Reorganized source code. The former big `view.js` is now split into [multiple files](https://github.com/muut/riotjs/tree/master/lib/tag)


### 2.0.7 *Jan 29, 2015*

- Super fast [in-browser compilation](compile.html) for: `<script type="riot/tag">`
- Built-in [Typescript support](compiler.html#typescript)
- Ability to plug in a HTML pre-processor (along with JS processor)
- Built-in [Jade support](compiler.html#jade)
- Ability to define [custom parsers](api/#route-parser) for router.
- Markup can be written with valid XML and HTML5 void tags are not self-closed
- Allow definition of empty placeholder tags. Good on development phase.
- `riot.observable()` now returns a new observable when called without the argument
- Compiler is now called like this:


```
var riot = require('riot')
var js_string = riot.compile(tag_source_string)
```


### 2.0.5 *Jan 27, 2015*

- An ability to plug in a JavaScript pre-processor

- `require('riot/compiler')` returns the compiler
- `riot.js` and `riot.min.js` are now found on the repository root
- hosted on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/riot) and [jsdelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!riot)
