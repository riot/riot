**Always start from `dev` branch**

### Coding style

- Leave out semicolons
- Use single quotes instead of double quotes
- Prefer `==` over `===` unless it's a must
- Spacing around brackets: `if (foo) {` instead of `if(foo){`
- Prefer classic conditionals `i < 0` over bitwise operators `!~pos`

``` javascript
var foo = 'bar',
    baz = 'boo'
```

instead of

``` javascript
var foo = 'bar'
var baz = 'boo'
```

### Something ready?
