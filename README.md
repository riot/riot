### The 1kb client side MVP library

Riot is an incredibly fast, powerful yet tiny client side (MV*) library for building large scale web applications. Despite the small size all the building blocks are there: a template engine, router, event library and a strict MVP pattern to keep things organized. On a finished application your views are automatically updated when the underlying model changes.

Current frameworks base their existence on following assumptions:

1. There's a big mass of common problems
2. MVC (or MVP) requires a framework
3. jQuery leads to spaghetti

Riot will [teach you](https://muut.com/riotjs/docs/) that none of the above is true. Client applications can be faster, simpler and smaller. They could be maintained with less people, less knowledge, and less worries.

*Riot is a manifesto for vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.*
